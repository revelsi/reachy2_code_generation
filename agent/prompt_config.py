# Critical warnings section
CRITICAL_WARNINGS = """
CRITICAL WARNINGS:
- NEVER use 'get_reachy()' or any functions from 'connection_manager.py'
- Carefully read the API documentation and make sure you follow the arguments and parameters guidelines.
- ALWAYS use properties correctly (e.g., reachy.r_arm NOT reachy.r_arm())
- For arm goto(), ALWAYS provide EXACTLY 7 joint values
- ALWAYS include time.sleep() after movement commands to ensure they complete before the script exits
- PREFER JOINT ANGLE CONTROL over Cartesian control whenever possible - it is much more reliable
- When using Cartesian control, ALWAYS use the correct orientation matrix (NOT identity matrix)
- For Cartesian control, use get_pose_matrix() from reachy2_sdk.utils.utils when possible
- ALWAYS handle "Target was not reachable" errors when using Cartesian space control or inverse kinematics
- ALWAYS check if a target pose is reachable BEFORE attempting to move to it using inverse_kinematics()
- ALWAYS have a fallback strategy using joint angles if a target pose is unreachable
- NEVER assume a target pose is reachable without checking first
"""

# Code structure section
CODE_STRUCTURE = """
REQUIRED CODE STRUCTURE:

1. INITIALIZATION PHASE:
   - Import ReachySDK from reachy2_sdk
   - Import time module for sleep calls
   - Connect to the robot: reachy = ReachySDK(host="localhost")
   - ALWAYS call reachy.turn_on() before any movement
   - ALWAYS call reachy.goto_posture('default') before any movement to reset the posture
   - Add time.sleep(2) after goto_posture to ensure it completes

2. MAIN CODE PHASE:
   - Always use try/finally blocks for error handling
   - Access parts as properties (reachy.r_arm, reachy.head, etc.)
   - Use proper method signatures from the API documentation
   - ALWAYS add time.sleep() after movement commands (e.g., time.sleep(duration + 0.5))
   - When using Cartesian space control, add try/except blocks to handle "Target was not reachable" errors
   - ALWAYS verify target pose reachability using inverse_kinematics() before attempting to move

3. CLEANUP PHASE:
   - ALWAYS use reachy.turn_off_smoothly() (NOT turn_off())
   - ALWAYS call reachy.disconnect()
   - Put cleanup in a finally block

# Safe target pose ranges
SAFE_RANGES = """
SAFE TARGET POSE RANGES (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT):

IMPORTANT NOTE: Direct Cartesian control has been found to be unreliable with the Reachy robot.
For most reliable results, use joint angle control instead of Cartesian coordinates.

JOINT ANGLE CONTROL (RECOMMENDED):
- Use reachy.r_arm.goto([j1, j2, j3, j4, j5, j6, j7], duration=1.0) for right arm
- Use reachy.l_arm.goto([j1, j2, j3, j4, j5, j6, j7], duration=1.0) for left arm

RELIABLE JOINT ANGLE CONFIGURATIONS:
- Right arm extended forward: [0, 0, 0, -90, 0, 0, 0]
- Right arm slightly to the side: [0, 10, -10, -90, 0, 0, 0]
- Right arm upward: [-45, 0, 0, -45, 0, 0, 0]
- Left arm extended forward: [0, 0, 0, -90, 0, 0, 0]
- Left arm slightly to the side: [0, -10, 10, -90, 0, 0, 0]
- Left arm upward: [-45, 0, 0, -45, 0, 0, 0]

IF YOU MUST USE CARTESIAN CONTROL:
1. ALWAYS use inverse_kinematics() with try/except to check reachability first
2. ALWAYS have a fallback strategy using joint angles if the target is unreachable
3. Keep movements small and incremental
4. CRITICAL: Use the correct orientation matrix - the identity matrix will NOT work properly
5. RECOMMENDED: Use the utility function get_pose_matrix() from reachy2_sdk.utils.utils:
   ```python
   from reachy2_sdk.utils.utils import get_pose_matrix
   # Parameters: position [x, y, z], orientation in Euler angles [roll, pitch, yaw]
   # For hand facing forward (common orientation):
   target_pose = get_pose_matrix([0.3, -0.2, 0.1], [0, -90, 0])
   ```
6. If creating matrices manually, use the proper rotation matrix for hand-forward orientation:
   ```python
   # Proper matrix for hand facing forward:
   target_pose = np.array([[0, 0, -1, x],  # Note the rotation part
                           [0, 1, 0, y],    # is NOT the identity matrix
                           [1, 0, 0, z],
                           [0, 0, 0, 1]])
   ```

WORKSPACE GUIDELINES:
1. Keep targets CLOSE to the robot's body
2. For complex movements, use joint angles directly instead of Cartesian coordinates
3. ALWAYS include error handling for unreachable targets
4. When creating paths or shapes, test each point individually for reachability

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
1. Using the identity rotation matrix for Cartesian control (this will likely fail)
2. Assuming a target pose is reachable without checking
3. Creating paths where ANY point is outside the reachable workspace
4. Not having a fallback strategy using joint angles
5. Using Cartesian control without proper error handling
